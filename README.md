# OfficeAnalyticsAdd-In
Microsoft Office JavaScript add-in for Excel. 

## Purpose

This project was created by myself (Evan Knouse) and Mike Sabares for COET295.

The purpose of the project is to expand the regression capabilities of Microsoft Excel, and give the user more robust control over their Excel data analysis.

As well, the project allows the user to integrate the regression function, via Simpson's rule, to find the area under the curve, further increasing the user's analysis capabilities.

## Further Work

In future iterations of the project, more advanced regression and curve fitting calculations will be used to provide analysis, including Gaussian regression, as well as under- and over-fitting adjustments. Integration precision options will also be implemented.
